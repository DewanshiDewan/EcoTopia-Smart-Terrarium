# EcoTopia-Smart-Terrarium
A smart terrarium that is self-sustained by using various
sensors such as LDR sensor, Temperature sensor, humidity sensor, Soil moisture
sensor, ultrasonic sensor as well as an Arduino MKR1000 WIFI and a 20x4 LCD screen. 
The referred parameters are such as the Temperature of the closed system, the
Humidity level inside the terrarium, Light intensity inside, the level of Soil
Moisture. 
Temperature:
Fan is turned on automatically by the system when temperature exceeds the
threshold. The fan is automatically turned off when the temperature comes under
the normal set value.
Humidity:
A misting system is automatically turned on given the humidity inside the terrarium falls
below the threshold and when it exceeds the correct set value, it is switched off
by the system.
Light Intensity:
Measured in units of LUX and when the light intensity drops below the
threshold level, polychromatic LEDs are turned on to mimic sunlight.
Soil Moisture:
A self-watering drip-irrigation system wherein when the moisture level in the soil falls below
the threshold, it is automatically pumped into the soil by the system.
